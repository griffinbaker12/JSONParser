# Inspiration
I have always wanted to understand how parsing works, so I implemented a JSON parser.
First in Python to better wrap my head around the problem, then in C to appreciate my Python solution.

# Notes
Two parts to the parsing process:
1) Lexical analysis -> split input into tokens
2) Syntactic analysis -> gets fed the tokens to find patterns to meet lang spec
