# Inspiration
I've always wanted to understand how parsing works.

# Reference
This [site](https://www.crockford.com/mckeeman.html) has super helpful as it has the complete JSON grammar.

# Notes
Two parts to the parsing process:
1) Lexical analysis -> split input into tokens
2) Syntactic analysis -> gets fed the tokens to find patterns to meet lang spec

There's nothing magic about this process, which, I guess, makes it kind of magic.
